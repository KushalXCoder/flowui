import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';
import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';

Flow UI is divided into two parts to give you maximum flexibility in how you build your project:

1.  **flowui/core**: Standalone components that are entirely self-contained. They only require Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
2.  **flowui/shadcn**: Components built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) primitives. These require a shadcn/ui setup.

Choose the installation method that matches the part of Flow UI you want to use:

<Tabs items={['flowui/core (Standalone)', 'flowui/shadcn (Shadcn)']}>
  <Tab value="flowui/core (Standalone)">
    ## Installing Core Components
    These components don't need shadcn/ui. This is ideal for lightweight projects or when you want to avoid adding the shadcn base.

    <Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Install Core Dependencies
    Install the required dependencies for animations and styling utilities:
    ```bash
    npm install motion clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Add Utility Function
    Ensure you have a `lib/utils.ts` (or `.js`) file to handle class merging. This is used by all Flow UI components:
    ```typescript title="lib/utils.ts"
    import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx"
    import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

    export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
      return twMerge(clsx(inputs))
    }
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Copy and Paste
    Navigate to any component under the **flowui/core** section, copy the source code, and paste it into your project (usually under `components/flowui/*`).
    </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="flowui/shadcn (Shadcn)">
    ## Installing Shadcn Components
    These components leverage shadcn/ui registry features for easy installation and dependency management.

    <Steps>
    <Step>
    ### Initialize Shadcn UI
    If you haven't already, initialize shadcn/ui in your project:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest init
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Configure Flow UI Registry
    Add our registry to your `components.json`. This allows the shadcn CLI to find and install Flow UI components:

    ```json title="components.json"
    {
      "registries": {
        "@flowui": "https://flowui-ten.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
      }
    }
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
    ### Add Components
    Install components directly using the shadcn CLI:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn@latest add @flowui/component-name
    ```
    </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
