### Initialize Shadcn UI

Flow UI acts as a registry extension to Shadcn UI. First, you need to initialize Shadcn UI in your project if you haven't already:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Configure Flow UI Registry

Add the Flow UI registry to your `components.json` file. This allows the CLI to resolve specific `@flowui` components.

Open `components.json` and add the `@flowui` entry to the `registries` object:

```json title="components.json"
{
  "registries": {
    "@flowui": "https://flowui-ten.vercel.app/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

</Step>

### Add Components

You can now add components directly using the CLI with the `@flowui` scope. For example:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @flowui/component-name
```

</Step>
